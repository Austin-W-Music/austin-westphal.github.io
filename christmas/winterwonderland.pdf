Winter Wonderland

**Verse 1:**
Snowflakes dance on the windowpane,  
Twinkling lights in the night’s refrain,  
In the glow of the fire’s warm embrace,  
We gather close in this special place.

**Pre-Chorus:**
The world outside is a winter’s dream,  
Inside, we’re wrapped in a love supreme,  
Every moment feels like a gift to share,  
With the ones we love, who will always be there.

**Chorus:**
It’s a Christmas wonderland,  
Holding hands and making plans,  
With joy that fills the air,  
And a magic everywhere,  
In this Christmas wonderland.

**Verse 2:**
Carols drift through the silent night,  
Hearts are full, the stars are bright,  
In the laughter and the holiday cheer,  
We find the meaning of this time of year.

**Pre-Chorus:**
The world outside may be cold and gray,  
But inside, we find a bright array,  
Of the love we give and the joy we find,  
In the season’s spirit, so warm and kind.

**Chorus:**
It’s a Christmas wonderland,  
Holding hands and making plans,  
With joy that fills the air,  
And a magic everywhere,  
In this Christmas wonderland.

**Bridge:**
Every wish upon a star,  
Every moment, near or far,  
Brings us closer to the dreams we share,  
In the wonder of this time, beyond compare.

**Chorus:**
It’s a Christmas wonderland,  
Holding hands and making plans,  
With joy that fills the air,  
And a magic everywhere,  
In this Christmas wonderland.

**Outro:**
So let’s cherish every smile,  
Every hug and every mile,  
As we celebrate this time so grand,  
In our Christmas wonderland.
